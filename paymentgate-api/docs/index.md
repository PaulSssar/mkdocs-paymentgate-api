- The final payment statuses may changed if the provider sends a new one. In such a case, you will receive a callback notification, and our technical support team will also inform you manually.
- The final payout statuses do not change, however, if there is a discrepancy with the provider, our technical support team will notify you manually, and such cases will be handled separately.

Header parameter for signing API-Sign is hash (SHA256) of string with format: **endpoint_secret_key+""+data_string**.

Where:

- endpoint_secret_key - this is secret key for signing queries. Created at endpoint settings in merchant account.
- data_string - request data formatted as json.

*Can be with delimeter spaces and without them, but not mix of both*
